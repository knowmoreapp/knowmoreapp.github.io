<h2>Thanks for visiting.</h2>
<p>
  We’re building continuous learning tools for professionals. We work with
  content creators, publishers, developers, and consumers. Our mission is to
  increase stickiness and engagement on the open-web.
</p>
<p>
  Content production doubles every year, but as consumers, we forget over 95% of
  it. The value of great content continues to diminish, though the potential is
  greater than it has ever been. We think we can help.
</p>
<p>
  Our KnowMore newsletter is a testament to our personalization strategy: treat
  every individual as a business, with unique needs. No algorithms, just great
  customer service.
</p>
<p>
  We’ve invented an AI driven trivia platform. We ingest content, and then use
  machine learning and natural language processing to identify key content
  tailored for Q&amp;A. This type of intelligent automation hasn’t been done
  before and is patent-pending.
</p>
<p>
  If you&#8217;re a content creator, in corporate engagement, accreditation, or
  education, we want to help.
</p>
<p>Our technology is also available by API. Reach out for more information!</p>
