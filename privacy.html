<h2>Welcome to KnowMore!</h2>

<p>
  As part of our mission to help busy professionals coordinate less, stress
  less, and experience more, KnowMore and its affiliates, collect and process a
  lot of information. This Privacy Policy is intended to help you better
  understand how we (Be I Journey Inc. d/b/a KnowMore) collect, use, and store
  your personal information — whether you are a business, merchant, or end user
  that uses KnowMore&#8217;s services. Whether you’re simply visiting this
  website or actively using KnowMore&#8217;s services through any method, you
  are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and, as applicable, the
  KnowMore Terms of Service.
</p>

<p>
  This Privacy Policy also describes how we collect, use and disclose your
  personally identifiable information (&#8220;PII&#8221;), including personally
  identifiable health or medical information (&#8220;Personal Health
  Information&#8221; or &#8220;PHI&#8221;). PII is information about you that
  may be used to identify you (such as your name, phone number, or address).
  Personal Health Information is PII combined with information that relates to
  (a) your past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition, (b)
  the provision of health care to you, or (c) your past, present, or future
  payment for the provision of health care.
</p>

<p>
  We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for
  example, changes to our privacy practices or for other operational, legal, or
  regulatory reasons. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we
  will give you notice of such changes by posting the revised policy on this
  Website, and where appropriate, by other means. By continuing to use this
  Website or the Support Service after these changes are posted, you agree to
  the revised policy.
</p>

<p>
  We are proud to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy by complying with
  the laws and regulations under applicable privacy laws in Canada, including
  the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act.
</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<p>
  At various points during your experience with KnowMore, you may provide us
  with information about yourself. For example, when you create an account
  through the Services, you provide us with personal information like your name,
  email address, and postal code. And if you place a task through the Services,
  we collect information including what you&#8217;re looking to achieve, the
  business or merchant details, and where you may be located. We may collect
  credit card information if a payment is due. We may collect additional
  information through Q&amp;A&#8217;s and surveys, to provide better assistance.
  Your account information may be updated or corrected by accessing your account
  settings or by contacting us. We will always collect your personal information
  by fair and lawful means.
</p>

<p>
  If you log into the Services through a third-party service, both we and that
  third-party may receive some information about you and your use of the
  services. For example, if you choose to log into the Services with your
  Facebook account, we may receive information from Facebook, such as your name,
  e-mail address, public profile information, and information about your
  contacts. We may also offer social sharing tools (such as the Facebook “Like”
  button) that let you share actions on the Services with other websites and
  vice versa. In those cases, the providers of those tools may receive
  information about you when you use those tools. You should check the privacy
  policies of these third party services and your settings there for more
  information.
</p>

<p>
  If you wish to invite your friends and contacts to use the Services, we will
  give you the option of either entering in their contact information manually
  or, for United States residents, importing it from your address books on other
  third party services. In both cases, we will store this information for the
  sole purposes of allowing you to send your friends referral offers, for
  determining whether your friends use the Services after a referral is sent,
  and, for United States residents, to remind your friends of the referral sent
  on your behalf.
</p>

<p>
  Location Information: When you use the Services, we may collect precise
  location data. If you allow the Services to access location services through
  the permission system used by your device&#8217;s mobile operating system or
  browser, we may also collect the precise location of your device. We use your
  location information to facilitate planning activities and appointments near
  your location, to assist you in finding nearby stores, and for other similar
  purposes and analytics purposes. You can choose whether or not to enable the
  location tracking feature through the settings on your device or browser, or
  when prompted by the KnowMore mobile app.
</p>

<p>
  Our Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age, and we do
  not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.
  If we obtain actual knowledge that any information we collect has been
  provided by a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information.
</p>

  entities outside of the Services when we have your consent to do so or it is
  done at your direction. For example:
</p>

<ul>

    we will share that information with the doctor&#8217;s office to better
    direct the appointment.

  </li>
  <li>
    KnowMore works with a variety of third parties and service providers to help
    provide you with our Services and we may share personal information with
    them to support these efforts.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  We do not and will never share, disclose, sell, rent, or otherwise provide
  personal information to other companies (other than to specific businesses
  that you are interacting with, or to third party apps or service providers
  being used by the businesses you are interacting with) for the marketing of
  their own products or services.
</p>

<p>We may also share your information in the following circumstances:</p>

<p>
  We sometimes share information with third parties to process information on
  our behalf or to otherwise provide certain services (such as delivery
  services, advertising services, or information to better tailor our services
  to you). For the purposes of this processing or provision of services, we may
  share your information with such third parties under appropriate
  confidentiality provisions.<br />
</p>

<p>
  We aim to prevent, investigate, or take action regarding illegal activities,
  suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety
  of any person, violations of our Terms of Service or any other agreement
  related to the Services, or as otherwise required by law.<br />
</p>

<p>
  We may, from time to time, share information to help us conduct marketing
  and/or advertising campaigns.<br />
</p>

<p>
  We sometimes share information to conform to legal requirements, or to respond
  to lawful court orders, subpoenas, warrants, or other requests by public
  authorities (including to meet national security or law enforcement
  requirements). Personal information may also be shared with a company that
  acquires our business, whether through merger, acquisition, bankruptcy,
  dissolution, reorganization, or other similar transaction or proceeding. If
  this happens, we will post a notice on our home page.<br />
</p>

<p>
  KnowMore will always ask for your consent before sharing your personal
  information with third parties for purposes other than those described in this
  policy.
</p>

<p>
  KnowMore is responsible for all onward transfers of personal information to
  third parties in accordance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, the
  Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, and Canada’s Personal Information
  Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA).

  <strong
    >What if the personal information we have for you is inaccurate?</strong
  ><br />
  You can, at any time, contact us to review, correct, update or otherwise
  modify the personal information we have for you. In each such case, you must
  clearly indicate the information that you wish to have changed or clearly
  indicate that you wish to have your personal information removed from our
  database. If you successfully demonstrate that the personal information we
  have for you is inaccurate or incomplete, we will amend our records of your
  personal information as required.
</p>

<p>
  Note that despite any request for a change to or removal of your personal
  information, we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping
  purposes, and there may also be residual information that will remain within
  our databases and other records, which will not be removed or changed.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>How fast will we respond to your requests?</strong><br />Please note
  that requests for changes to your personal information, even those submitted
  through our Sites, may not be effective immediately. We will attempt to
  respond to any requests regarding personal information as soon as reasonably
  possible, and in any event not later than 10 business days after receipt of
  each such request. We will advise you in writing if we cannot respond to any
  of your requests within this time limit. You have the right to make a
  complaint to the federal Privacy Commissioner in respect of this time limit.
</p>

<p>
  <strong
    >How do we know that it is really you requesting your personal
    information?</strong
  ><br />We may request that you provide us with sufficient identification
  before granting you access to information regarding the existence, use or
  disclosure of your personal information. Any such identification information
  shall be used only for this purpose.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Personal Health Information</strong><br />This Section (Personal
  Health Information) governs our use and disclosure of your Personal Health
  Information. If there is a conflict between the terms of this Section and any
  other terms of this Privacy Policy or the KnowMore Terms of Services, the
  terms in this Section will govern. To the extent we receive, create, maintain,
  use or disclose any of your PHI, we will maintain the privacy and security of
  such information as required by the federal patient privacy law known as the
  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the regulations
  promulgated under that Act (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;), as well as any applicable
  provincial, state, and other federal privacy policy laws.
</p>

<p>
  Your PHI is protected under HIPAA and under certain state laws. Those laws
  give you rights with respect to the access, use, and disclosure of PHI by your
  health care providers, such as doctors, pharmacies, and us. Information
  concerning your status as a patient is PHI and protected by HIPAA. For a more
  complete description of your rights under HIPAA and the uses and disclosures
  of your PHI, please refer to your practitioner&#8217;s Notice of Privacy
  Practices. We will not disclose your PHI without your prior written consent
  with other people or non-affiliated companies unless: (i) it is needed to
  provide our Services, (ii) it has been &#8220;de-identified&#8221; so that it
  cannot identify you, (ii) we have your prior written consent, (iv) disclosure
  is required by law, or (v) we are acquired or file for bankruptcy.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Security</strong><br />We employ administrative, physical, and
  technical measures designed to safeguard and protect information under our
  control from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. These measures include
  encrypting your communications by utilizing Secure Sockets Layer
  (&#8220;SSL&#8221;) software, and using a secure messaging service when we
  send your PHI electronically. In addition, when we collect, maintain, access,
  use, or disclose your PHI, we will do so using systems and processes
  consistent with information privacy and security requirements under applicable
  federal and state laws, including, without limitation, HIPAA. All electronic
  PHI will be encrypted at rest and in transit.
</p>

<p>
  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage,
  is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your
  personal information. We will make any legally required notifications of any
  breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your PHI or PII,
  including, without limitation, breaches of your stored PHI or PII (as breaches
  are defined under applicable provincial or federal statutes on security breach
  notification). To the extent permitted by applicable laws, we will make such
  notifications to you in the most expedient time possible and without
  unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law
  enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the
  breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Automated Decision Making</strong><br />
  In the course of offering our services, KnowMore uses a number of machine
  learning algorithms and forms of automated decision-making. For example, we
  use automated decision-making to categorize events, to run research tasks, to
  personalize date plans, and to make appointments.
</p>

<p>
  Most of these algorithms (excluding the personalization features and a subset
  of customer risk/fraud screening, discussed in more detail below) are not
  fully automated and include some human intervention (for example, customer
  risk and fraud scores are provided to merchants, who must intentionally decide
  how to act on them).
</p>

  the KnowMore Privacy Officer by emailing hello@knowmore.app
